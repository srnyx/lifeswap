# LifeSwap

Death swap except when you die, your opponent steals health from you. *Originally made for [mothlet](https://youtube.com/channel/UCXJe1zf6xUxcTjjBwQK068w).*

When someone dies, their opponent will steal a configurable amount of health from them. The game continues until someone reaches 0 health.

Multiple games can be running at once.
