# LifeSwap

Death swap except when you die it takes a heart from max health. *Made for [mothlet](https://youtube.com/channel/UCXJe1zf6xUxcTjjBwQK068w), go check them out!*

Upon swapping (5 seconds after running the swap command), there'll be a 30-second timer, when the timer ends, it'll detect if someone died. If someone did, that player's max health will be lowered, you can continue swapping until one player has no more max health left.
